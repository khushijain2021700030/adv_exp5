### **Word Cloud of Furnishing Status**

**Question Answered**:

What is the distribution of different furnishing statuses in the dataset?

**Observation**:

-   "Semi-furnished" is the most frequent furnishing status, followed by "Unfurnished" and "Furnished."

-   This indicates that a significant number of houses or apartments in the dataset are semi-furnished, making it the dominant furnishing status.

ggplot(data, aes(x = furnishingstatus, y = price, fill = furnishingstatus)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Prices by Furnishing Status",

       y = "Price") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5) 
  )
```

### **Boxplot of Prices by Furnishing Status**

**Question Answered**:

How do prices vary based on the furnishing status?

**Observation**:

-   The median price is highest for "Furnished" properties, followed by "Semi-furnished" and then "Unfurnished."

-   Furnished properties tend to have the highest range of prices, while unfurnished ones have a lower price range, showing a clear relationship between furnishing and property value.

    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12)  
  )
```

### **Boxplot of Area vs. Guestroom**

**Question Answered**:

How does having a guestroom impact the area of the house?

**Observation**:

-   Houses with a guestroom tend to have a larger median area compared to those without a guestroom.

-   This suggests that homes with guestrooms are typically larger, providing more space overall.

  )
```

### **Violin Plot of Area by Stories**

**Question Answered:**

How does the area of a property vary based on the number of stories?

**Observations:**

-   **1-Story Buildings**: These have the widest range of areas, with a high density of smaller properties but also a few large properties.

-   **2-Story Buildings**: The area distribution is more concentrated compared to 1-story buildings, with most properties being in the middle range of areas.

-   **3-Story Buildings**: The area distribution narrows further, suggesting that properties with 3 stories tend to have a more consistent area size. There are fewer extreme values, and the bulk of the data lies in the middle.

-   **4-Story Buildings**:The distribution for 4-story buildings is the narrowest, with most properties having similar areas.

  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5), 
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),  
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12)   
  )
```

### Violin Plot: Price vs. Air Conditioning

**Question Answered:**

How does the price of a property vary based on the presence of air conditioning?

**Observations:**

-   **Properties without Air Conditioning**: The price distribution shows concentration of properties at lower prices.

-   **Properties with Air Conditioning**: The price distribution here is also broad, but there seems to be a greater density around mid- to higher-price ranges.

    Properties with air conditioning generally have a higher price range, which could suggest that air conditioning adds value or is a common feature in more expensive properties.

  )
```

### **Linear Regression: Area vs Price**

**Question Answered:**

How does the area of a property affect its price, and is there a linear relationship between them?

**Observations:**

-   **Positive Correlation**: The scatter plot shows a clear positive correlation between property area and price. As the area increases, the price also tends to rise.

-   **Linear Trend**: The blue regression line indicates the linear trend between area and price, suggesting that for larger properties, the price generally increases at a consistent rate.

-   **Variability**: While there is a strong positive correlation, the points are spread around the regression line, particularly at higher areas. This indicates that while area is a strong predictor of price, other factors may also influence property prices, especially for larger properties.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "red") +
  labs(title = "Nonlinear Regression: Area vs Price", 
       x = "Area", 
       y = "Price") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),  
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12)   
  )
```

### Nonlinear Regression: Area vs Price

**Question Answered:**

Is there a nonlinear relationship between the area of a property and its price, and how does the price vary across different property sizes?

**Observations:**

-   **Nonlinear Trend**: The red LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) curve shows a nonlinear relationship between the area and price, suggesting that the relationship is not purely linear. The price increase varies across different ranges of the area.

-   **Lower Areas**: In the lower area range, the slope of the curve is steeper, suggesting that as the area increases in this range, the price rises more sharply.

-   **Middle Areas**: For medium-sized properties, the price increases at a relatively steady pace.

-   **Higher Areas**: In the higher area range, the curve starts to flatten, showing a diminishing rate of price increase. This suggests that after a certain point, adding more area to a property may result in only marginal increases in price, reflecting a saturation point in value for very large properties.

```{r}
plot_ly(data, x = ~area, y = ~bedrooms, z = ~price, type = 'scatter3d', mode = 'markers',
        marker = list(size = 5, color = ~price, colorscale = 'Viridis')) %>%
  layout(
    title = '3D Plot: Area, Bedrooms, and Price',
    scene = list(
      xaxis = list(title = 'Area'),
      yaxis = list(title = 'Bedrooms'),
      zaxis = list(title = 'Price')
    )
  )
```

### **3D Plot: Area, Bedrooms, and Price**:

**Question Answered:**

How do the number of bedrooms and the area of a property together affect its price?

What is the 3-dimensional relationship between these three variables?

**Observations:**

-   **Price as the Color Gradient**: The color gradient (Viridis scale) represents price, with darker colors indicating lower prices and brighter colors representing higher prices.

-   **Positive Correlation**: Generally, properties with a higher number of bedrooms and larger areas tend to have higher prices, visible through the clustering of brighter points in the upper-right region of the plot.

-   **Outliers**: There may be some outliers where the price is either unusually high for a smaller property or relatively low for a larger one, potentially due to other factors not captured in this 3D plot (such as location, amenities, or condition of the property).

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = factor(parking), y = price)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = factor(parking))) +
  labs(title = "Jitter Plot of Parking vs Price", 
       x = "Parking Spaces", 
       y = "Price") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),  
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),  
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12)   
  )
```

### **Jitter Plot of Parking vs. Price**

**Question Answered:**

How does the number of parking spaces relate to property prices?

**Observations:**

-   Properties with more parking spaces (e.g., 2 or more) generally tend to have higher prices, as observed by the concentration of points at higher price ranges.

-   Most properties seem to have 1 or 2 parking spaces, and the prices for these properties are more densely packed.

-   There are some outliers where properties with fewer parking spaces have significantly higher prices, possibly due to other factors like location or property size.

data$bathrooms <- as.factor(data$bathrooms)

ggplot(data, aes(x = bathrooms, y = price)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0, aes(color = bathrooms)) +
  labs(title = "Jitter Plot: Bathrooms vs. Price", 
       x = "Bathrooms", 
       y = "Price") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),  
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12), 
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12)  
  ) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Number of Bathrooms")  
```

### **Jitter Plot: Bathrooms vs. Price**

**Question Answered:**

How does the number of bathrooms influence the price of a property?

**Observations:**

-    Properties with more bathrooms (e.g., 2 or more) generally show a trend toward higher prices. The concentration of higher-priced properties increases as the number of bathrooms rises.

-    For properties with fewer bathrooms (1-2), there is a wider range of prices, meaning that properties with the same number of bathrooms can have very different prices depending on other factors.

-   This indicates that while the number of bathrooms influences price, other features like area, location, and amenities also play a significant role.
